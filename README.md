# SARS-CoV-2 CAI across species

This repository includes the code upon submission used to reproduce the results and plots of the manuscript "Genetic variability in ACE2 explains infectivity in species and suggests different resistance degrees in humans". Data used in the code is retrieved from:
- Codon frequencies of species from CoCoPUT: https://hive.biochemistry.gwu.edu/dna.cgi?cmd=codon_usage&id=576245.
- Codon usage of all coding sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from RefSeq (NC_045512.2).
